# Welcome to the psse3304_python_tutorial

This project is based on the premise that the 3304 version of psse software and the installed pssepath installation package are installed, and the main example is the use of ieee39 buses calculation. It mainly contains steady state tidal current calculation and transient fault simulation under different operating conditions. All the functions of this project are realized based on the python language and the api interface of psse software, which is documented in the folder DOCS. This tutorial is very suitable for newbies who have already installed the software and want to realize the automated simulation based on psse software through python language.

# Getting Started

1. Installed version 3304 of the psse software and pssepath installer.
2. Choose the python environment that comes with the psse software as the python interpreter.
3. Line-by-line debug read of generate_freq_data.py script.
